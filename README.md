# World of RNA Binding Proteins and Genomic Annotations-A Python Data Visualization Project

This project involves recreating and analyzing fictitious genomic annotations alongside RNA binding protein data through various data visualization techniques using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main tasks:

1. **Create Visualizations for Protein Signals**  
   Three alternative visualizations were created to represent genomic transcripts and RNA binding protein signals. These visualizations help to understand genomic annotations and protein interactions.

2. **Composite Figure with Multiple Panels**  
   A multi-panel figure combining scatter plots, bar plots, and genomic annotation plots was created to provide a holistic view of the data.

3. **K-mer Counts in DNA Sequences**  
   A k-mer counting algorithm was implemented to analyze DNA sequences, counting occurrences of specific nucleotide patterns at each position and visualizing the distribution.

## Datasets

- `anno.csv`: Fictitious genomic transcript information.  
- `sig.csv`: RNA binding protein signal data for four proteins (P1, P2, P3, P4).  
- `scttr.csv`: Data for the scatter plot visualization.  
- `bar.csv`: Data for the bar plot visualization.  
- `seq.txt`: DNA sequence data for k-mer counting analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.11  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy  

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afzalsufiya/World-of-RNA-Binding-Proteins-and-Genomic-Annotations-A-Python-Data-Visualization-Project.git

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to generate all visualizations and analyses.
